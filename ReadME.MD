### Break down the regular expression for validating Visa card numbers

^4: This part checks if the card number starts with the digit 4.  The ^ symbol signifies the beginning of the string.  Visa cards always begin with a 4.

\d{12}: This requires exactly 12 digits to follow the initial 4. \d represents any digit (0-9), and {12} means "exactly 12 occurrences".

(\d{3})?: This is an optional group. The parentheses () create a group, and the ? after it makes the whole group optional (it can appear zero or one time). Inside the group, \d{3} expects exactly three more digits. This part accounts for the fact that some Visa cards have 13 digits (the initial 4 plus 12 digits), while others have 16 digits (the initial 4 plus 12 digits plus an additional 3 digits).

$: This symbol signifies the end of the string. It ensures that there are no other characters after the 12 or 15 digits we've already matched.

In summary, the regex checks for a string that:

Starts with the digit 4.
Is followed by exactly 12 digits.
May or may not have an additional 3 digits.
Has nothing else after those digits.
This allows the regex to correctly identify both 13-digit and 16-digit Visa card numbers while rejecting any other formats.
